# MyVulkanRHI
## brief
My vulkan RHI design playground, explore how VulkanRHI should be designed and used to integrate it into my [GameEngineFromStratch](https://github.com/moonflo/EngineFromScratch) repo.
## Install
1. Download [VulkanSDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/) on your pc, notice that currently this code only tested on windows;
1. Clone this repo (Make sure it's a clone but NOT download as ZIP file, for we have a submodule in this);
2. Run build_all.bat for the initial install of all external dependencies;
3. visual studio sln is in ./build, for any code modification one should only run the rebuild.bat for it;

## TODO:
1. Check my code in others pc, make sure this code is as flexible as possible;
